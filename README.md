## Project Description

A project will be undertaken to build a Chair Rotation Scheduler for a shared office
environment. 
- In this system, employees will be allowed to book chairs for specific
time slots to ensure that seating is fairly rotated and double-bookings are avoided.
Different types of chairs—such as ergonomic chairs, bean bags, and high stools—
will be managed separately, and their availability will be shown in real-time.
- Once a booking is made, a notification will be sent to confirm the reservation.
- Admins will have the authority to block certain chairs during cleaning hours, maintenance, or team events.
- A usage history will be maintained to identify the most popular seating
types and peak usage hours.
- Over time, booking patterns will be analyzed to
optimize space allocation and improve the overall seating experience for everyone
involved.
